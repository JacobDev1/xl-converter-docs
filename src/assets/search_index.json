        "content": "Formats Formats - Introduction There are two types of compression: Lossy - file size shrinks along with the quality Lossless - file size can shrink, but the quality stays the same Formats - Overview Great quality at a small size but not widely adopted and slow to convert. JPEG XL - great for both lossy and lossless AVIF - as good as JPEG XL at lossy Web standard, fast to convert, and mostly supported. WEBP - a better replacement for JPG and PNG. The lossless mode works great and lossy is still decent. Large size, but compatible with everything. JPG - lossy only, a 30-year-old format with poor quality that people need to stop using PNG - lossless only Formats - Lossy JPEG XL Quality 90 - visually lossless 80 - high quality and reasonable size 60 - space saving sweet-spot Effort - higher is better 7 - regular speed and good quality 9 - slow speed and better quality. Always results in a smaller size for Lossless and Modular. For VarDCT it can be smaller, but it's not a rule. Intelligent Effort - prioritizes smaller file sizes JPEG XL - Lossy Mode Default - encoder decides (favors VarDCT) VarDCT - best for natural or complex images, like photographs Modular - best for images with sharp edges and flat areas, like digital art, screenshots, documents, etc. AVIF Constant Quality - lower is better quality and bigger size 70 - high quality and reasonable size 50 - medium quality 30 - bad quality Speed - lower is better 6 - good default 0 - very slow, best quality and smallest size WEBP Quality 90 - great quality, but large size 80 - good compromise between quality and size 60 - looks fine only far away, I wouldn't go any lower The mode (-m) is always set to 6 for better quality and smaller file size. JPG Quality Encoder JPEGLI from JPEG XL - the highest quality JPG encoder available. Preserves accurate colors with fewer artifacts and smaller size. Handles text and screenshots noticeably better. 2x faster than ImageMagick. ImageMagick - stable, trusted and tested. Photos end up slightly sharper compared to JPEGLI (not related to quality). Formats - Lossless Manual Select JPEG XL, WEBP or PNG then check Lossless. The alternative, Lossless (only If smaller) converts to both lossy and lossless, then picks the smaller one. It's especially useful with WEBP Smallest Lossless XL Converter features Smallest Lossless mode which converts to multiple formats, and then picks the smallest one. Use the checkboxes to disable the ones you don't want. Each format is good at a different thing JPEG XL - complex images (e.g. photographs) WEBP - simple images (e.g. screenshots) PNG - very simple images JPEG XL automatically appends JPG reconstruction data in this mode.

Resolution Clamps the resolutions to fit in the selected range. Percent Scales to that percentage. Example: 80% will result in a 20% smaller image Shortest and Longest Side Makes a particular side fit under the selected size. Helpful with vertical images. File Size You should pick a different mode whenever possible. This one is very slow. File Size (KiB) - desired file size Auto (Linear Regression) - faster and better algorithm. Files may end up slightly bigger than the desired file size. Step (%) - value used to progressively shrink an image Tip: to preserve higher resolution, decrease the quality in the Format Tab. Resampling Methods You should not change this unless you know a lot about resampling. By default, Lanczos will be used. You can enable custom resampling in the Settings Tab (Custom Resampling checkbox). Notes Intelligent Effort (in JPEG XL) is compatible with all downscaling types Downscaling is unavailable for animated images and in the \"Smallest Lossless\" mode "

        "content": "JPEG XL vs AVIF Lossy Efficiency Both JPEG XL and AVIF provide similar quality with different strengths. Recommended uses: AVIF Screenshots Digital Art Synthetic Imagery JPEG XL Photos Large Images (8k) Scanned Documents Visual Comparison Images have been cropped and upscaled. The differences may not be noticeable in everyday use. Photos JPEG XL (VarDCT, Quality 90) - 3.7 MiB AVIF (Quality 90) - 4.6 MiB JPEG XL yields a smaller size and produces fewer artifacts than AVIF in photos with high-quality preset. Experts may prefer it for its high bit-depth and high-resolution support. On the other hand, AVIF produces sharper images in medium to low-quality presets. Digital Art Regular JPG (Quality 53) - 168 KiB JPEG XL (Modular, Quality 80) - 167 KiB AVIF (Quality 80) - 168 KiB AVIF performs best on images with sharp edges and flat areas. It also maintains accurate colors. Note It's hard to make an accurate comparison, so try comparing yourself. Convert an image to both formats, import them into a canvas in GIMP, then toggle between the layers. Lossless JPEG XL lossless mode is very efficient. WEBP may perform better on certain images, but on average JPEG XL is the best. AVIF does feature a lossless mode, but I decided not to implement it as it is much worse than WEBP's. Conversion Speed Lower is better Format Encoder Speed Notes JPG JPEGLI 1.7 s JPG ImageMagick 4.3 s JPEG XL libjxl 11.5 s JPEG XL libjxl 15.5 s No XL Converter (bash script) AVIF libavif 25.9 s Speed / Effort were set to default. XL Converter makes encoders faster by running them in parallel.

Bugs are to be expected. The JPEG XL repo states the following: \"Note: This release is for evaluation purposes and may contain bugs [...]\" AVIF is more stable in this regard. Additional Information It's important to note that both AVIF and JPEG XL significantly outperform HEIF. Samples: Digital Art / Photos XL Converter uses AOM-AV1 for AVIF. Other AV1 encoders provide worse quality. Keep this in mind when comparing your results. "
