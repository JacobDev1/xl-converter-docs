Patreon - support the project while getting the program The Official Website GitHub - for the tech savvy You should download XL Converter only from the aforementioned links. Installation Windows Double-click on the downloaded file. You will get a warning, click on More Info (link) Run Anyway (button) This happens for every program that hasn't rented an expensive digital signature, which serves no other purpose than to remove this popup. The Ardour developers put it nicely into words . Linux Unpack the archive Run ./install.sh A shortcut will be added to both the start menu and the desktop. Image Viewers You will need to install an image viewer with support for AVIF and JPEG XL. Windows ImageGlass - easiest to use XnViewMP PhotoQt PicView nomacs - alternatives Linux AVIF Install the package. sudo apt install libavif-gdk-pixbuf Detailed tutorial JPEG XL If you're security conscious, you might want to just stick with AVIF. Download the latest binaries for your distribution. Unpack then install them sudo dpkg -i *deb Detailed tutorial Updates Check for updates in the About tab . Is XL Converter Safe? The program is safe to use and the source code is publicly available. "

        "content": "Formats Formats - Introduction There are two types of compression: Lossy - file size shrinks along with the quality Lossless - file size can shrink, but the quality stays the same Formats - Overview Great quality at a small size and but not widely adopted and slow to convert. JPEG XL - great for both lossy and lossless AVIF - as good as JPEG XL at lossy Web standard, fast to convert and mostly supported. WEBP - a better replacement for JPG and PNG. Lossless mode works great and lossy is still decent. Large size, but compatible with everything. JPG - lossy only, a 30-year-old format with poor quality that people need to stop using PNG - lossless only Formats - Lossy JPEG XL Quality 90 - very high 80 - high quality and reasonable size 60 - space saving sweet-spot Effort - higher is better 7 - regular speed and good quality 9 - slow speed, better quality, and sometimes smaller file size Intelligent Effort - chooses the appropriate effort for the image type and settings. It prioritizes smaller file size, but often ends up also improving the quality. AVIF Constant Quality - lower is better quality and bigger size 20 - high quality and reasonable size 30 - space saving sweet-spot 40 - reasonable limit for space-saving (looks way worse than 30) 50 - very low quality Speed - lower is better 6 - good default 0 - very slow, best quality and smallest size WEBP Quality 90 - great quality, but large size 80 - good compromise between quality and size 60 - looks fine only far away, I wouldn't go any lower Formats - Lossless Manual Select JPEG XL, WEBP or PNG then check Lossless . The alternative, Lossless (only If smaller) converts to both lossy and lossless then picks the smaller one. It's especially useful with WEBP Smallest Lossless XL Converter features Smallest Lossless mode which converts to multiple formats then picks the smallest one. Use the checkboxes to disable the ones you don't want. Each format is good at a different thing JPEG XL - complex images (e.g. photographs) WEBP - simple images (e.g. screenshots) PNG - very simple images JPEG XL automatically appends JPG reconstruction data in this mode. JPEG XL vs AVIF The visual differences in lossy mode are negligible but one may perform slightly better in a given context. Preferred format: Text images - JPEG XL Full-page website screenshots - JPEG XL Photographs (high quality) - tie Anime drawings from Pixiv - AVIF Desktop screenshots - AVIF Photographs (low quality) - AVIF If you're unsure, try out both. These criteria are arbitrary and may not be representative. Technical differences AVIF is supported by most web browsers and JPEG XL isn't AVIF does not feature (a good) lossless mode AVIF is more secure (lower attack vector, based a video codec) "

        "content": "Downscaling Downscaling is available in the Modify tab . All methods maintain the same aspect ratio . They only scale the image down, not up. Dynamic Downscaling Choose Max File Size from the list and set the File Size (KiB) to your preferred value. File Size (KiB) - maximum allowed size Step (%) - smaller is more precise, but bigger is faster. Keep between 5% - 20% Tip: to preserve higher resolution, decrease the quality in the Format Tab . If a converted image is already smaller than the declared file size, no downscaling will occur. Manual Downscaling Percent Scales to that percentage. Example: 80% will result in a 20% smaller image Max Resolution Clamps the resolutions to fit in the selected range. Shortest and Longest Side Makes particular side fit under selected size. Helpful with vertical images. Resampling Methods By default, Lanczos will be used. You should not change this setting unless you have a very specific reason to. You can enable custom resampling in the Settings Tab ( Custom Resampling checkbox). Methods Lanczos - best default Point (a.k.a. Nearest Neighbor) - jagged edges Other methods are mostly useless on their own. Notes Intelliget Effort (in JPEG XL) is compatible with all downscaling types Downscaling is unavailable for animated images and in the \"Smallest Lossless\" mode "

You can compile every part of this program yourself. All encoders are standard, which means you can easily swap them. What are the requirements?
