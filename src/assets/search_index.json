        "content": "Formats Formats - Introduction There are two types of compression: Lossy - file size shrinks along with the quality Lossless - file size can shrink, but the quality stays the same Formats - Overview Great quality at a small size but not widely adopted and slow to convert. JPEG XL - great for both lossy and lossless AVIF - as good as JPEG XL at lossy Web standard, fast to convert, and mostly supported. WEBP - a better replacement for JPG and PNG. Lossless mode works great and lossy is still decent. Large size, but compatible with everything. JPG - lossy only, a 30-year-old format with poor quality that people need to stop using PNG - lossless only Formats - Lossy JPEG XL Quality 90 - very high 80 - high quality and reasonable size 60 - space saving sweet-spot Effort - higher is better 7 - regular speed and good quality 9 - slow speed, better quality, and sometimes smaller file size Intelligent Effort - prioritizes smaller file sizes AVIF Constant Quality - lower is better quality and bigger size 70 - high quality and reasonable size 50 - medium quality 30 - bad quality Speed - lower is better 6 - good default 0 - very slow, best quality and smallest size WEBP Quality 90 - great quality, but large size 80 - good compromise between quality and size 60 - looks fine only far away, I wouldn't go any lower The mode (-m) is always set to 6 for better quality and smaller file size. Formats - Lossless Manual Select JPEG XL, WEBP or PNG then check Lossless. The alternative, Lossless (only If smaller) converts to both lossy and lossless, then picks the smaller one. It's especially useful with WEBP Smallest Lossless XL Converter features Smallest Lossless mode which converts to multiple formats then picks the smallest one. Use the checkboxes to disable the ones you don't want. Each format is good at a different thing JPEG XL - complex images (e.g. photographs) WEBP - simple images (e.g. screenshots) PNG - very simple images JPEG XL automatically appends JPG reconstruction data in this mode.

        "content": "Downscaling Downscaling is available in the Modify tab. All methods maintain the same aspect ratio. They only scale the image down, not up. Resolution Clamps the resolutions to fit in the selected range. Percent Scales to that percentage. Example: 80% will result in a 20% smaller image Shortest and Longest Side Makes particular side fit under the selected size. Helpful with vertical images. File Size You should pick a different mode whenever possible. This one is very slow. File Size (KiB) - desired file size Auto (Linear Regression) - faster and better algorithm. Files may end up slightly bigger than desired file size. Step (%) - value used to progressively shrink an image Tip: to preserve higher resolution, decrease the quality in the Format Tab. Resampling Methods You should not change this unless you know a lot about resampling. By default, Lanczos will be used. You can enable custom resampling in the Settings Tab (Custom Resampling checkbox). Notes Intelligent Effort (in JPEG XL) is compatible with all downscaling types Downscaling is unavailable for animated images and in the \"Smallest Lossless\" mode "

Safe Wipe - deletes all except the data affecting the final image. Preserve - copies over all metadata. Unsafe Wipe - deletes every last bit of metadata, including color profile.

Yes, the limits are JPEG XL - 32 bit AVIF - 12 bit The Legacy JPG, WEBP, Smallest Lossless and Downscaling are limited to 8 bit. What are the hardware requirements? System: Windows 10 64-bit (1809 or later) Linux 64-bit (kernel 5.15 or later) Processor: a quad-core made in the last decade RAM: 4 GB minimum 8 GB recommended (Linux) What is the difference between \"Installer\" and \"AppImage\"? Installer (recommended) - launches faster, sets up permissions, and adds shortcuts AppImage - takes up less space "

        "content": "JPEG XL vs AVIF Lossy Efficiency Both JPEG XL and AVIF provide similar quality with different strengths. Recommended uses: AVIF Desktop Screenshots Digital Drt Saving Space Medium to Low Quality Preset JPEG XL Scanned Documents Website Screenshots (full-page) Large Images (8k) High Quality Preset Lossless Images Visual Test All Images are first converted, then cropped and enlarged to emphasize differences. These differences will not be noticeable in everyday use. All file sizes are roughly the same. Digital Text Legacy JPG JPEG XL AVIF AVIF produces digital text with better colors and fewer artifacts Digital Art Legacy JPG JPEG XL AVIF AVIF excels in maintaining accurate colors and edges with fewer artifacts in digital art. JPEG XL does generate occasional gray spots and blurs non-outlined edges. Photos JPEG XL AVIF The visual quality of both is similar, but JPEG XL usually yields smaller file sizes for the same quality. On the other hand, AVIF performs better with medium to low quality preset. Very Large Images The image used here is large full-page screenshots. As previously mentioned, all images have been cropped. Legacy JPG JPEG XL AVIF For large images (8 k) JPEG XL outperforms AVIF, regardless of context and produces much smaller file sizes. Suggestion To compare, convert an image to both formats, import them into a canvas in GIMP, then toggle between them. See which one you like. Execution Time (Speed) Lower is better Format Speed Legacy JPG 1x JPEG XL (XL Converter) 2.5x JPEG XL (cjxl - base) 5x AVIF 5.8x Capabilities Feature JPEG XL AVIF Max Resolution 1,073,741,823 x 1,073,741,823 *65536 x 65536 Max Bit Depth 32 bit 12 bit Compatibility Low High Lossy Excellent Excellent Lossless Excellent Bad Encoding Speed Fast Slow Transparency Yes Yes Security Average Good Additional Features JPEG Reconstruction *Only 8193 x 4320 natively, larger sizes are achieved with tiling (which lowers efficiency beyond this resolution) Additional Information While JPEG XL is more future-oriented, it's still in its early stages. AVIF, on the other hand, is more refined. The JPEG XL's GitHub page mentions that each release is intended for evaluation and may contain bugs. If you choose to use JPEG XL, you may need to deal with technical issues. It's important to note that both AVIF and JPEG XL significantly outperform HEIF. I am not affiliated with any format or their developers, nor have I received a single cent for the 1000+ hours of work I have done on XL Converter. Credits: Digital Text / Digital Art / Photos Encoders: cjxl from libjxl 0.8.2 / libavif (AOM-AV1 3.8.0) XL Converter uses AOM-AV1 for AVIF. Other libraries will not perform as well. "
