        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h2>Is XL Converter free?</h2>
        <p>Yes, even for commercial use. It's licensed under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">GPLv3</a>.</p>

        <h2>How does it make money then?</h2>
        <p>It doesn't, which is why it could use your <a href="https://codepoems.eu/donate/" target="_blank">donation</a>.</p>

        <h2>Is XL Converter safe?</h2>
        <p>Of course! The entire source is publicly available. Encoder binaries come either from the official sources or are compiled by myself.</p>
        <p>You can compile every part of this program yourself. All encoders are standard, which means you can easily swap them.</p>
        
        <h2>What are the requirements?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>System:
                <ul>
                    <li>Windows 10 64-bit (1809 or later)</li>
                    <li>Linux 64-bit (kernel 5.15 or later)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Processor: a quad-core made in the last decade</li>
            <li>RAM:
                <ul>
                    <li>4 GB minimum</li>
                    <li>8 GB recommended</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What are the "Intelligent Features"?</h2>
        <p>They are my original concept, namely:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dynamic Downscaling</li>
            <li>Intelligent Effort</li>
            <li>Smallest Lossless</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each one automates the conversion process in some way - saving you time. XL Converter is the first program to have such features.</p>
